What is the Vintage
===================

The old, the foundation, the spirit of Machine Learning: 
:doc:`Calculus<calculus/intro>` |
:doc:`Optimization<optimization/index>` |
:doc:`Linear Algebra<linear_algebra/index>` |
:doc:`Probability<probability/index>` |
:doc:`Artificial Intelligence<artificial_intelligence/index>` |
:doc:`Machine Learning<machine_learning/index>`

And yes, we will touch base on Machine Learning in the end, fully prepard.

Why the Vintage
=====================================

Machine learning stuff draws eyeballs and too many youngs and olds are taking the bad route to the nightly build, the unstable, and the cutting edge.

In Vintage land, we go gentle from a solid foundation to make you comfort no matter what new tech you learn.
