Symmetrics
*****************

Naturally they are used a lot to describe co-occurance between two variables.

Property
===========

Orthogonal Eigenvectors

Transformation
-------

Positive Determintive Symmetrics
=====

Positive Determintive
-----

semi-Positive Determintive

Application
-----

A lot physical models can be represented by SPD

Eclipse
	equation

Energy
	equation

Multivariable derivative
	:ref:`hessian` 

	f(x,y) is at its minimum if f'=0 and f''>0
	
	f'' can be represented by matrix A
	
	if A is SPD, then f''>0
