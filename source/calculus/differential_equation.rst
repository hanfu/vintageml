Differential Equation
*******************************

Differential equations are equation sets that involves derivatives. There solution is a set of functions. 

They are essentially the same as our old friend equation set and equation root, just replaced some number operation to derivative operations.


Solutions
==============

通常的解法是, 我们尽量把一个未知变量用已知的数字或者其他未知变量表示出来, 然后将新的公式带回到原方程中, 一个一个消掉未知变量, 最后求得确定的解或者解方程组.
