Derivative
***************

We review the limit quickly, and than expand to the definition of derivative.

Limit
==========

Derivative
===============

Derivative is the change of a funciton to its variable. 

derivative = :math:`\frac{df(x)}{dx}` = df(x)/dx, sometimes abbreviated as f'. 

Differentiation
===============

The process to find out derivative is called differentiation. 



Properties of Differentiation
==========
given function f, and three ascending number a,b,c, then we can get the following theorem:


mean value theorem
---------------------------

extreme value theorem
---------------------

convacity
---------

integral
